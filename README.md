2. Rename the visualization video files to "`first`-`no`.mp4" where `first` is your first (i.e. _given_) name and `no` is a sequential number (e.g. "orwa-1.mp4", "orwa-2.mp4", etc.). If you are competing with one entry, then name the file "`first`.mp4" where `first` is your first (i.e. _given_) name.
