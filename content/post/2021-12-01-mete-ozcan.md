This is Mete's entry for the competition.

I made one video, I used to listen metal music when I was at University. This is one of the classics created by a legendary group named AC/DC.

## Command Variations

I tried different things, the jitter command seems to help me achieve what I wanted to achieve because of this and that.

### Competition Entry 1

```bash
   python `visualize.py` --song `song file` --batch_size 1 --duration 27 \
   --pitch_sensitivity 230 --jitter 0.3 \
   --output_file `video file`
```
