This is Ali's entry for the competition.



## Command Variations

I tried different things, I changed the music audio to be a romantic guitar. I made one videos, I was inspired by the romantic guitar in the sub-continent.Traditionally musical traditions have been passed on orally and musical skills have often been taught from father to son or teacher to pupil. Students pay respect to their instructors by kissing their feet. The relationship between teachers (known as pandits and gurus among Hindus and ustaad among Muslims) and their pupils is very important in Indian music. Teachers and pupils are often related, and the spiritual element of the instrument is often as important as technical virtuosity. In northern India, the spiritual relationship is symbolized by a ceremony in which a teachers ties a string around the wrist of a pupil
