This is Ivana's project video made by deep-music-visualizer.

I made four videos. I experimented with parametars and the last one proved to be the best one.

## Command Variations

The tempo was very important as the rhythm is quite fast. I was also trying to get in the video more pictures of the people than animals, but in the end I gave up and just used random numbers. Somehow this way I got 2 pictures with people, compered with my previous tries which had none.
