This is Orwa's entry for the competition.

I made one video, I was inspired by the song called taro. This song usually reminds me of travelling.

## Command Variations

I tried different things, but as I changed things get less interesting. I havent created a note for the classes I used, I picked random numbers sequentials. I have other videos as well, one with birds and other with dos but havenÂ´t uploaded.

### Competition Entry

   python `visualize.py` --song `taro.wav` --batch_size 4\
