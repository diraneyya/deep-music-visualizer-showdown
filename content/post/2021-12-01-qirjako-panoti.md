This is ********qp**************'s entry for the competition.

I tried too many videos, but I uploaded only one which I think it is the most representable.

## Command Variations

I think the most important think is to choose a song with low tempo and clear sound and harmony change. That will produce interesting and dinstriguishable images.

### Competition Entry 1

```bash
   python `visualize.py` --song `stones.wav` --resolution 512 --duration 20 --batch_size 10 --pitch_sensitivity 280
--output_file `stones_batch10_pitch_output.mp4`
```
{{<video `stones_batch10_pitch_output.mp4`>}}
